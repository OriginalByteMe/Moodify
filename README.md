# The Moodify app

## Your Music, Your Mood, Instantly.

This is a little side project that will retrieve colour palletes from any spotify song, and then alter a background to suite it!

This is also a partial data-collecting project, where I collect the rgb values of every song found and stored in a MongoDB database! The dataset will be public and accessible.
